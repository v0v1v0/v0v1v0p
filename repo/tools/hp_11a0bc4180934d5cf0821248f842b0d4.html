<h2>Convert Titles to Title Case</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Convert a character vector to title case, especially package titles.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">toTitleCase(text)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr>
<td><code id="text">text</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is intended for English text only.
</p>
<p>No definition of<U+2018>title case<U+2019> is universally accepted: all agree
that <U+2018>principal<U+2019> words are capitalized and common words like
<U+2018>for<U+2019> are not, but not which words fall into each category.
</p>
<p>Generally words in all capitals are left alone: this implementation
knows about conventional mixed-case words such as <U+2018>LaTeX<U+2019> and
<U+2018>OpenBUGS<U+2019> and a few technical terms which are not usually
capitalized such as <U+2018>jar<U+2019> and <U+2018>xls<U+2019>.  However, unknown
technical terms will be capitalized unless they are single words
enclosed in single quotes: names of packages and libraries should be
quoted in titles.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A character vector of the same length as <code>text</code>, without names.
</p>
