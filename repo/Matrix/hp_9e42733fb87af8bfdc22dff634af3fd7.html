<h2>Defunct Functions in Package <span class="pkg">Matrix</span>
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The functions or variables listed here are no longer part of
<span class="pkg">Matrix</span> as they are no longer needed.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Defunct in 1.3-3
rBind(..., deparse.level = 1)
cBind(..., deparse.level = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These either are stubs reporting that they are defunct, or
have been removed completely (apart from being documented here).
</p>
<p><code>rBind</code> and <code>cBind</code> were provided for <span class="rlang"><b>R</b></span> versions
older than 3.2.0 as substitutes for the <span class="pkg">base</span> analogues
<code>rbind</code> and <code>cbind</code>, which at that time were not
<U+201C>S4-aware<U+201D> and so could not be used to vertically or
horizontally concatenate <code>"Matrix"</code> objects
together with traditional matrices and vectors.
